    <h2>Applied Work</h2>

    <p>I build systems with Recursive Sequence as the core architecture of both my personal life and professional direction. The documents below are expressions of this framework applied across multiple domains. While I continue refining these systems, I’m seeking contract or full-time work to support this recursive build-out — ideally in roles that benefit from structural clarity, technical patterning, and recursive insight.</p>

    <h3>The Recursive Sequence (Preview)</h3>
    <p>This is the engine. A recursive lens built to map, clarify, and structure abstract systems — internal and external. Below is a two-page sample. The full seven-page document is available on request.</p>

    <h3>Integrating into Complex Systems (Multi-Purpose Professional Sample)</h3>
    <p>A structured three-phase approach to onboarding new contributors with clarity, strategic observation, and minimal disruption. Designed to help teams scale without losing context.</p>

    <h3>Bridging Internal Worlds (Multi-Purpose Professional Sample)</h3>
    <p>A cross-functional clarity guide for reducing misalignment between product, engineering, and support. Offers practical tools for designing multi-role documentation that translates — not just communicates.</p>

    <p>Additional samples are under construction, including works in diagnostics, gamification systems, and public technical SOPs. I continue building these systems whether I’m hired or not — but I’d prefer to work while I do.</p>
