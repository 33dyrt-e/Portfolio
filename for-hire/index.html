    <h2>For Hire</h2>

    <p>I build systems with Recursive Sequence as the core architecture of both my personal life and professional direction. The documents below are expressions of this framework applied across multiple domains. While I continue refining these systems, I’m seeking contract or full-time work to support this recursive build-out — ideally in roles that benefit from structural clarity, technical patterning, and recursive insight.</p>

    <h3>The Recursive Sequence (Preview)</h3>
    <p>This is the engine. A recursive lens built to map, clarify, and structure abstract systems — internal and external. Below is a two-page sample. The full document is available on request.</p>

    <h3>Cybersecurity Systems (Tutorial Sample)</h3>
    <p>This sample demonstrates my ability to compress technical cybersecurity processes into instructional clarity. The document includes tutorial-style guidance based on common SOC/blue-team frameworks.</p>

    <h3>Physiology Explained (Conceptual Sample)</h3>
    <p>Excerpt from a larger system I’m developing around physical health, recursive modeling, and instructional design for intuitive understanding of anatomy. </p>

    <p>Additional samples are under construction, including works in diagnostics, gamification systems, and public technical SOPs. I continue building these systems whether I’m hired or not — but I’d prefer to work while I do.</p>
