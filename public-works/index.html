    <h3 style="color: #5c0099;">Seven Ways, Same Rūt</h3>
    <p>Seven Ways is a quiet little book about seven patterns of movement. It doesn’t teach. It hums. And sometimes, it sounds like you.</p>

    <h3 style="color: #5c0099;">A Recursive Sequence</h3>
    <p>A recursion engine for those who burn their own blueprints. This is not a manual. This is a reflection, disguised as system. If it reads clearly, you’ve already stepped too deep.</p>

    <h3 style="color: #5c0099;">Skill Issue: The Degen Gospel</h3>
    <p>Written as a spell and released as a scream. This work will not ask for your respect. It’s already beyond you if you’re still waiting for permission to read.</p>
